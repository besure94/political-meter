## Political Meter

#### By Brian Scherner

#### An application that evaluates users political beliefs.

## Description

This application allows users to answer several questions with "yes" or "no" answers. The answers are then evaluated and display the results to the user. The results are either "liberal", "moderate", or "conservative", depending on how the user answered. If they answer anything other than "yes" or "no", the application will return a message saying that their beliefs are undetermined due to how they answered.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository to your desktop.
* Navigate to the index.html file in the directory.
* Open index.html in your browser.

## Known Bugs

Currently, the application will not be able to accurately evaluate if a users beliefs are "moderate", because the "or" expression is not properly expressed. I plan to fix this later. Also, if users enter a different assortment of answers other than what is defined in the "if" expression, their results will not be displayed. I plan to fix this bug once I learn more about forms, and how to more easily organize data and structure it into more concise, accurate expressions.
